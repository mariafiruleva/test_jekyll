<div class="acknowledgments-text">Acknowledgements enable you to thank all those who have helped in carrying out the research. Careful thought needs to be given concerning those whose help should be acknowledged and in what order. The general advice is to express your appreciation in a concise manner and to avoid strong emotive language. The acknowledgement page is placed after the title page in the case of a report, and after the table of contents and lists in the case of a major work. It is part of the introductory pages, and as such is numbered in Roman numerals, usually in small capitals. If the acknowledgements are very brief, they may appear at the end of the foreword.</div>
